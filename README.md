# LotteryApp

## Description
LotteryApp is an iOS application that allows users to view lottery draw results, purchase tickets for specific draws, and check if they've won. The app includes the following features:
- Display a list of available lottery draws.
- View detailed information for each draw.
- Purchase a lottery ticket for a selected draw date.
- Check if the generated ticket has won based on pre-defined rules.
- View the winning rules within the app.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode**: Ensure you have Xcode installed on your Mac. 
- **Swift**: The project is built using Swift and SwiftUI.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Ensure LotteryAppTests.swift is in the LotteryAppTests directory, and everything else is in the LotteryApp directory
3. To run the app, select a target device to simulate and run the app on. (I used iPhone 15 Pro)
4. Press the play button near the top left of XCode to build the simulator and run the app

## Technology Choices
- In terms of mobile app development, XCode and Swift are the technologies I have the most experience with. As a result it seemed like the best choice for this task.
- Xcode integrates seamlessly with XCTest, Appleâ€™s framework for testing. This makes it straightforward to set up and run unit tests. The ability to run tests directly within the IDE and see real-time feedback simplifies the development process.
